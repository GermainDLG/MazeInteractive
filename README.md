A simple pathfinding interactive where the user can explore different
pathfinding algorithms with their own created mazes/designs. Currently implements
BFS, Greedy, and A* Search algorithms with displayed time showing time to run.
To start, install pygame as instructed by the website:
run "python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user" in the terminal to install pygame
Then, just run "python main.py" in the console
